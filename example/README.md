# Minimal Content Blocker

This is a minimal webextension doing adblocking/antitracking using most popular
block-lists. It is meant as a very thin wrapper around the [adblocker](https://github.com/cliqz-oss/adblocker)
library.

## Building

1. Build the extension: `make all`
2. Load it in Firefox or Chromium by using the "Load unpacked extension" feature
